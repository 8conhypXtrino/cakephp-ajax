## How to Improve Your Skills in Company of Heroes 2 Without Using a Trainer
  
While using a trainer can be fun and easy, it can also make you miss out on the challenge and satisfaction of playing Company of Heroes 2 the way it was meant to be played. If you want to improve your skills and become a better commander, you might want to try some of these tips and tricks that don't require any cheating or hacking.
  
These tips and tricks are based on the advice and experience of veteran players who have mastered the game's mechanics and strategies. They will help you gain an edge over your opponents, whether they are AI or human, and make you enjoy the game more.

1. Learn the Game Behind the Game. This tip was already mentioned in the previous section, but it bears repeating. Company of Heroes 2 is not just about moving units around and shooting at enemies. It's also about managing your resources, building your base, researching your tech, choosing your doctrine, and adapting to the changing conditions of the battlefield. You need to understand how each of these aspects work and how they affect each other. You need to know what units are good for what situations, what upgrades are worth investing in, what abilities are useful in different scenarios, and what tactics are effective against different factions. You need to plan ahead, anticipate your enemy's moves, and react accordingly. You need to balance offense and defense, aggression and caution, expansion and consolidation. You need to learn from your mistakes and improve your decision making. The more you play, the more you will learn.
2. Use Cover and Flanking. Cover is one of the most important features of Company of Heroes 2. It can make a huge difference in combat, as it reduces the damage and suppression your units receive from enemy fire. Cover comes in different types: green (heavy), yellow (light), red (negative), and white (none). Green cover provides the best protection, while red cover actually increases the damage you take. Yellow cover is somewhere in between, while white cover means you are exposed. You can find cover in various objects on the map, such as sandbags, walls, fences, craters, buildings, etc. You can also create cover by using some abilities or units, such as barbed wire, tank traps, trenches, etc. You should always try to position your units in cover whenever possible, especially when facing enemy fire or artillery. However, cover is not foolproof. It can be destroyed by explosives or vehicles, it can be flanked by enemies who attack from different angles, and it can be negated by some weapons or abilities that ignore cover. Flanking is a tactic that involves attacking an enemy from the side or rear, where their cover is less effective or nonexistent. Flanking can give you a significant advantage in combat, as it can increase your damage output, lower your enemy's morale, and force them to retreat or surrender. Flanking can be done by using fast or stealthy units, such as light vehicles, snipers, or commandos. It can also be done by using smoke grenades or artillery barrages to obscure your enemy's vision and create an opening for your flankers. You should always look for opportunities to flank your enemies whenever possible, especially when they are dug in or entrenched.
3. Use Combined Arms and Synergy. Combined arms is a strategy that involves using different types of units together to achieve greater effectiveness than using them separately. For example, using infantry and tanks together can create a powerful force that can deal with both enemy infantry and vehicles. Using artillery and recon together can create a deadly combination that can bombard enemies from afar with pinpoint accuracy. Using engineers and mines together can create a defensive line that can slow down or stop enemy advances. Combined arms can help you overcome your enemy's strengths and exploit their weaknesses. Synergy is a concept that refers to how well different units work together and complement each other's abilities. For example, using shock troops and flamethrowers together can create a synergy that can clear out enemy garrisons or bunkers with ease. Using snipers and spotters together can create a synergy that can extend their range and vision. Using medics and officers together can create a synergy that can heal and buff your troops faster. Synergy can help you maximize your unit's potential and efficiency.
4. Use Hotkeys and Control Groups. Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform 8cf37b1e13

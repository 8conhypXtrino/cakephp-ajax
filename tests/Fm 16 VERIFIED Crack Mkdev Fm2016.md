### 1. Utilise free transfers and the loan market
 
One of the most important aspects of Football Manager is building a strong squad that can compete at any level. However, this can also be very expensive and difficult, especially if you have a limited budget or a low reputation. That's why you should always look for bargains in the transfer market, such as free agents and loan deals.
 
Free agents are players who are not contracted to any club and can be signed for free. You can find them by using the player search filter and selecting "contract status: expired". You can also use the staff search filter and select "contract status: expired" to find free staff members, such as coaches and scouts.
 
Loan deals are temporary transfers that allow you to borrow a player from another club for a certain period of time, usually a season or half a season. You can find them by using the player search filter and selecting "transfer status: listed for loan". You can also use the scout reports and shortlists to find loan targets.
 
Free transfers and loan deals can help you improve your squad quality and depth without spending any money. They can also help you fill gaps in your squad or cover injuries and suspensions. However, you should also be careful not to sign too many players on free transfers or loans, as this can affect your wage budget, squad harmony, and player development.
 
### 2. Don't always listen to your scout reports
 
Scouts are essential staff members who can provide you with valuable information about players and teams. They can help you identify potential signings, analyse opponents, and discover hidden gems. However, they are not always accurate or reliable. They can make mistakes, miss important details, or have biased opinions.
 
That's why you should not always listen to your scout reports blindly. You should always do your own research and analysis before making any decisions. You should also compare different scout reports from different scouts or sources, such as websites or forums.
 
You should also pay attention to the scout attributes and ratings. These affect how well they perform their job and how trustworthy their reports are. The most important attributes for scouts are judging player ability, judging player potential, adaptability, determination, level of discipline, motivation, tactical knowledge, man management, and working with youngsters. The scout ratings are based on their knowledge of different regions, nations, divisions, competitions, and players.
 
You should try to hire scouts with high attributes and ratings in the areas that interest you. You should also assign them to scout specific regions, nations, divisions, competitions, or players that match your needs. You should also review their scout reports regularly and give them feedback or instructions.
 
### 3. In the lower divisions, play with two strikers
 
If you are managing a lower division team or a team with limited resources, you might want to consider playing with two strikers instead of one. This can give you an advantage over your opponents who usually play with one striker or none at all.
 
Playing with two strikers can increase your attacking threat and goal scoring chances. It can also create more space and opportunities for your midfielders and wingers. It can also put more pressure on your opponents' defence and force them to make mistakes.
 
However, playing with two strikers also has some drawbacks.

Why Convert PDF to DWG?
 
PDF files are widely used for sharing and printing documents, but they are not ideal for editing and modifying drawings or designs. PDF files are usually raster images, which means they are composed of pixels that lose quality when zoomed in or out. PDF files also do not retain the layers, blocks, dimensions, and other data that are present in DWG files.

DWG files, on the other hand, are vector files, which means they are composed of lines and curves that can be scaled without losing quality. DWG files also preserve the original information and structure of the drawing or design, such as layers, blocks, dimensions, and attributes. DWG files are more suitable for editing and modifying drawings or designs with CAD software and applications.
 
Therefore, if you want to edit or modify a drawing or a design that is in PDF format, you may want to convert it to DWG format first. This way, you can access and manipulate the data and elements of the drawing or design more easily and accurately.
